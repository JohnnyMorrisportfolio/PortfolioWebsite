    <h2>About</h2>
    <p> Hello I'm Johnny Morris. I am a former sales professional that took a deep look into myself and wondering my why?. I took a self inventory and thought extensivley about what it is that i did particulary well. As a former sales manager I was great at problem solving and thinking outside of the box in order to increase productivity exceed in sales goals. My venture into the software dev began with playing around with html and css which began to peak my curiosity. Looking at it began to be fun almost like having a puzzle and figuring out the pieces. This in turn helped me want to buckle down and enroll into a fullstack bootcamp at Nucamp.  </p>
